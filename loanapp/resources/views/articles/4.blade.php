                 <p>Let’s talk about loans. They’re like coffee—sometimes you need a quick shot (hello, espresso!) and sometimes you want something slow-brewed and substantial. But when it comes to borrowing from FNB, the big question is: <strong>secured or unsecured?</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Secured Loans: The "Put Your House (or Car) on It" Option</h2>
    <h3>What’s a Secured Loan, Anyway?</h3>
    <p>A secured loan is like borrowing money from a friend—but with a catch. Instead of a pinky promise, you have to give them something valuable as a backup. In banking terms, that “something valuable” is collateral—like your car, home, or investments.</p>
    
    <h3>Why Choose a Secured Loan?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower Interest Rates</strong> – Banks love security.</li>
        <li><strong>Bigger Loan Amounts</strong> – Need a high loan amount? This is the way.</li>
        <li><strong>Longer Repayment Terms</strong> – More time to pay means lower monthly installments.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Unsecured Loans: The "No Strings Attached" Option</h2>
    <h3>What’s an Unsecured Loan?</h3>
    <p>An unsecured loan is like a handshake deal—except with a bank. No collateral needed. FNB gives you the money based on your credit score and income.</p>
    
    <h3>Why Choose an Unsecured Loan?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Faster Approval</strong> – Need cash ASAP? This is the faster option.</li>
        <li><strong>No Risk of Losing an Asset</strong> – No collateral, no repossession risk.</li>
        <li><strong>More Flexible Uses</strong> – Use it for emergencies, travel, or personal expenses.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Secured vs. Unsecured Loans: The Face-Off</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Secured Loan</th>
            <th>Unsecured Loan</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Interest Rates</td>
            <td>Lower</td>

            <td>Loan Amounts</td>
            <td>Higher</td>
            <td>Lower</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Approval Process</td>
            <td>Slower</td>
            <td>Faster</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Risk Factor</td>
            <td>Asset at risk if you default</td>
            <td>No asset risk, but higher penalties</td>
        </tr>

    <h2>How to Choose the Right Loan for You</h2>
    <h3>Go for a Secured Loan if:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You need a large loan (house, car, major investment).</li>
        <li>You have an asset and want lower interest rates.</li>
        <li>You’re financially stable and confident in repayment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Go for an Unsecured Loan if:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You need fast cash without collateral.</li>
        <li>You don’t own assets (or don’t want to risk them).</li>
        <li>You have good credit and can handle the higher interest.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>FNB’s Loan Application Process: What to Expect</h2>
    <p>Applying for a loan at FNB is straightforward. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ID & Proof of Income</strong> – To verify your ability to repay.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit Check</strong> – A better credit score = better loan terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Form</strong> – Online, via the FNB app, or in-branch.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Final Thoughts: Which Loan is Best for You?</h2>
    <p>The "best" loan depends on your situation. Need a large sum with low interest? A secured loan is your best bet. Need quick cash with no collateral? An unsecured loan is the way to go.</p>
